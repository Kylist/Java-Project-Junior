This game plays off of a simple cognitive bias called the confirmation bias. People are predisposed to look for information that confirms their beliefs. If you believe the rule is something like “each number is twice as large as the last number” you are going to make guesses that confirm your belief. Each positive answer will further reinforce your belief.
In science, we need to check our hypotheses by attempting to falsify them, or prove them wrong. We need to attempt to disprove the rule, by checking sequences that don’t follow our hypothesized rule.

If the user enters the word “answer” or some other string you choose to indicate the player is ready to end the game and guess.
–	In this case, prompt the user to guess our game’s rule, then output the answer.
–	You don’t have to tell the user if he guessed the rule correctly; it would be beyond the scope of this Lab.
•	Three numbers separated by spaces.
–	Let’s call a trio of numbers and the corresponding output a Guess. Once a user makes a Guess, we will store it (how? see below).
–	If the user enters a sequence that follows the rules, output “Yes!”
–	Otherwise output “No.”

If the user enters the word “previous”, display all the previous Guesses the user made (the numbers and whether they were right or wrong)
•	Treat any other entry as an exception.
